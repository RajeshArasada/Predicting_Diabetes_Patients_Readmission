## Problem Definition
### What is a Readmission?
Admission to a hospital within 30 days of a discharge from the same or another hospital. The numbers are disturbing and disappointing. According to the federal government, one in five elderly patients winds up back in the hospital within 30 days of leaving. The cost is troubling, too. The readmission of Medicare patients alone costs $26 billion annually, $17 billion of which is spent on return trips that wouldnâ€™t need to happen if patients received proper care during their first visit.

## EHR Dataset Levels
![EHR](/images/EHR_dataset_levels.png)

### Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset is at the encounter level
The following code is used to select only the first encounter of each patient
        
       :::python3
       def select_first_encounter(df):
       '''
       df: pandas dataframe, dataframe with all encounters
       returns:
           - first_encounter_df: pandas dataframe, dataframe with only the first encounter for a given patient
       '''
                first_encounter = df.sort_values(["encounter_id", "patient_nbr"], ascending=[True, True]). \
                               groupby("patient_nbr").head(1).reset_index(drop=True)
                return first_encounter

## Prevalance
       
       :::python3
       def compute_prevelance(df, col):
            """
            Count number of occurrences of each value in array.
            Args:
                df - DataFrame
                col - array
            Returns
                prevelance
            """
            neg, pos = np.bincount(df[col])
            prevelance = 100 * pos / (neg + pos)
            return prevelance

## Numeric Data
### Normalization Techniques at a Glance

**CLIPPING** - caps all feature values above (or below) a certain value
        * 'num_medications'
        * 'num_lab_procedures'
        * 'number_diagnoses'

**LOG_SCALING** - compress a wide range to a narrow range
        * 'number_inpatient'
        * 'number_outpatient'
        * 'number_emergency'

**Standard Scaling**
        * All features will be standardized using the Z-score

## Categorical Data
### High Cardinality of Diagnostic Codes(ICD-9)

        :::python3
        def reduce_diag_dimensionality(dataframe, col):
                """
                reduce the dimensionality of the diagnostic codes by grouping them to one level up
                df - dataframe
                col - diagnostic code column
                returns:
                - grouped col with codes grouped at one level high    
                """
                # 1. pad all codes with zeros at the begining with zfill() upto 3
                dataframe[col] = dataframe[col].str.zfill(3)
                # 2. extract the first two characters and store them into a different column
                new_colname = 'grouped_'+ col
                dataframe[new_colname] = dataframe[col].map(lambda x: x[:2] if type(x) is str else x)
                dataframe.drop(col, axis=1, inplace=True)
                return dataframe

## Splitting Data into Train/Validation/Test data

        :::python3
        def split_dataset_patient_level(df, key, test_percentage):
                """ Splits data into Train and Test without data leakage"""
                df = df.iloc[np.random.permutation(len(df))]                    # random shuffle the data
                unique_values = df[key].unique()                                # unique patients
                total_values = len(unique_values)                               # number of unique patients   
                sample_size = round(total_values * (1-test_percentage))         # sample size
                train = df[df[key].isin(unique_values[:sample_size])].reset_index(drop=True) #subset train_df
                test = df[df[key].isin(unique_values[sample_size:])].reset_index(drop=True)  # subset test_df
                return train, test

## Model performance on validation data
![Model Performance on validation data](/images/confusion_matrix_thresh_50.png)
-------------------------------------
#### Confusion Matrix (threshold=0.5)
-------------------------------------
The confusion matrix is a 2-by-2 matrix laying out correct and incorrect predictions made in each label.

Patient Class 0 - Patients **NOT readmitted**

There are **(top left and top right quadrants)** 3721 patients in this class. The model correctly predicted the outcome for 3418 patients, i.e; ~92% of them.

Patient Class 1 - Patients **Readmitted**

Of the **(bottom left and bottom right quadrants)** 366 patients in this class the model captured only 45 patients, i.e; ~12.2% of them. 

## Cumulative Gain Curve
**If the healthcare provider's goal was to reach say 50% of the patients that are most likely to be readmitted then using the cumulative gain curve they can determine that roughly just about 40% of the most likely most likely patients would need to be used to achieve that.**

# Top Features
![Best and Worst Features](/images/features_25.png)

## Summary
* The model built here should be used only to predict readmission of patients of the Caucasian race in the age group of 50-90 years old. Deploying this model on any other race or age group can result is significant errors.


* The model identified the following features as most important in predicting readmission: 
    
    *	Time a patient spent in the hospital
    
    *	Number of diagnosis
    
    *	Number of procedures a patient underwent
    
    *	Number of lab procedures a patient underwent
    
    *	The number of medications the patient is prescribed
A high value of these features indicate that the patient is probably very sick and needs continuous attention. 


* The model also identifies patients with diseases associated with the circulatory and the respiratory systems as a high-risk group. This is consistent with published research that people suffering heart diseases and infections such as pneumonia are more likely to be readmitted than others in the hospital.


* Age is another important factor in determining if a patient is readmitted or not. Older people between 60-90 years are more likely to be readmitted. It is also important to keep in mind that the majority of the patients in the dataset are in this age.


* The model performs about 1.2 times better than a random guess in identifying readmitted patients. To identify at least 50% of the readmitted patients, according to the model the healthcare provides should target 40% of the most likely patients.
